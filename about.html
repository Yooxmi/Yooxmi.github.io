                    </br>
                Something must've gone wrong in my brain</br>
Got your chemicals all in my veins</br>
Feeling all the highs, feeling all the pain</br>
Let go on the wheel, itâ€™s the bullet lane</br>
Now I'm seeing red, not thinking straight</br>
Blurring all the lines, you intoxicate me</br>
</br>
Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine</br>
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need</br>
All I need, yeah, you're all I need</br>
</br>
It's you, babe</br>
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe</br>
And I could try to run, but it would be useless</br>
You're to blame</br>
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same</br>
It's you, babe</br>
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe</br>
And I could try to run, but it would be useless</br>
You're to blame</br>
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same</br>
</br>
I'll never be the same</br>
